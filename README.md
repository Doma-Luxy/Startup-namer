# Startup namer

## About Flutter:
Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

In this codelab, you'll create a simple mobile Flutter app. If you're familiar with object-oriented code and basic programming concepts—such as variables, loops, and conditionals—then you can complete the codelab. You don't need previous experience with Dart, mobile, or web programming.

## About this app:
This is a simple app which gemerates randomly cool names for startups. Using the "Heart" icon you can save your favourite names, and review them in the upper right drawer.
The main aspects of this app are the use of an external package, in this case `english_words`, a `stateful widget` and an infinite `ListView`.
