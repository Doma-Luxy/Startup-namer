# Startup namer

## About Flutter:
Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

## About this app:
This is a simple app which generates randomly cool names for startups. Using the "Heart" icon you can save your favourite names, and review them in the upper right drawer.
The main aspects of this app are the use of an external package, in this case `english_words`, a `stateful widget` and an infinite `ListView`.
